# 🧩 Labyrinth Solver Robot using Tiva C & Ultrasonic Sensor

This project presents the design and implementation of an autonomous labyrinth-solving robot capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and wheel encoders. The system is developed using the Tiva C LaunchPad (EK-TM4C123GXL) and programmed through the Energia IDE.

## Project Overview

The robot is designed to navigate through a labyrinth(single path with no branch) autonomously.
It continuously moves forward, detects obstacles in its path, scans for alternative directions using a servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor, and chooses the optimal path to proceed.

The system integrates:

- Ultrasonic sensing for distance measurement

- Motor driver for robot movement

- Servo motor for directional scanning

- Optical encoders for speed and movement feedback
