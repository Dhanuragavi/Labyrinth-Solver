# 🧩 Labyrinth Solver Robot using Tiva C & Ultrasonic Sensor

This project presents the design and implementation of an autonomous labyrinth-solving robot capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and wheel encoders. The system is developed using the Tiva C LaunchPad (EK-TM4C123GXL) and programmed through the Energia IDE.
